## Getting started

The app is hosted live here https://nyarlathotep.netlify.app and can be freely used
for testing purposes.

## Testing payments

The app currently is connected to a stripe demo site which allows to perform a mock
payment. Just refer to this doc page https://stripe.com/docs/testing

## Testing chat

The chat should work fine for you on the deployed app straightaway. However,
sometimes netlify might cause some issues here due to the pricing tier selected for
the app. The chat feature requires a lot computation power due to it's ai powered
backend and sometimes this is too much for netlify free tier. If you encounter this
issue please run the app locally for testing.
